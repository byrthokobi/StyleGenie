# 🧞‍♀️ StyleGenie – Your Smart Personal Stylist

StyleGenie is a web-based AI-powered styling assistant that helps users find the perfect outfit combinations based on their body type, face shape, skin tone, occasion, budget, and wardrobe. It also connects users with professional human stylists for personalized fashion guidance and lets stylists monetize their expertise directly on the platform.

## 📌 Project Context

In developing countries and fashion-conscious communities, many individuals face challenges in getting access to affordable, personalized fashion advice. Trained stylists are often inaccessible, and online tools rarely provide localized or budget-sensitive outfit recommendations.

**StyleGenie** solves these problems by combining manual user input with AI-generated outfit suggestions, wardrobe tracking, and one-on-one professional stylist sessions — all in one platform. The system bridges the gap between AI convenience and human creativity, making fashion both accessible and affordable.
